#grow_unblocked_moves_in_dir(dx,dy)
#each invocation of the method goes 1 direction at a time
#save the positions it can validly move in an array
#recursive until a piece can't move any more
    #off the board
    #can't move through own piece
    #can't move past an opponent piece
#call this in moves method 4 times (1 for each direction) (8 times on the queen)


#create moves method


#move_dirs should just raise an error in this module and should be overridden in a subclass
